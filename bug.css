The following CSS rule uses an invalid property:

```css
div {
  font-size: larger;
}
```

The `larger` keyword is not a valid value for the `font-size` property.  It's meant to be used in relative sizing contexts, but not on its own.  This will likely result in the `font-size` being ignored or defaulting to the browser's default.
